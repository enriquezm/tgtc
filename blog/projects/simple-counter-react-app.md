I wanted to understand event handlers more when working with React, so I built a simple counter. Since _just_ a counter app was too boring for me, I wanted to add some simple animation for feedback with [React Pose](https://popmotion.io/pose/).

I never used React Pose before, but after hearing about it from the React 2018 Conference in Las Vegas, I was fascinated by the library. 

Check out my simple app on [codepen](https://codepen.io/mylesenri/pen/oaOJLP) and see what you think.
