I love developing new habits that benefit me and so I decided to create a small little React app that allowed me to start, continue, and develop habits that lasted.

That basic idea for the app is to check-in and done. Simple and to the point. I love the idea of having a github contribution type interface to visually keep track of your progress.

A simple demo can be viewed on [codesandbox.io](https://codesandbox.io/s/3v8l0o7p7p) to get a better idea.
