title: Bill Checklist App
description: A small app using native drag-n-drop functionality.
sourceCode: 'https://github.com/enriquezm/bills-todo-app'
---

I wanted to build something simple without React. The idea was this: Build something similar to what I would do with pencil and paper, but make it a little more interactive. The first thing that came to mind was an app that handled drag-n-drop.

I've always seen these "todo" type lists built, but they were using some type of JavaScript library. I wanted to see how I could achieve this without a library. Why? To better understand why libraries were built for this in the first place.

After building this small app, I learned the following:

- Working with the DOM
- Native JavaScript functions for handling drag-n-drop
- Using CSS for subtle feedback

This app is pretty basic, but I learned a lot from it.
