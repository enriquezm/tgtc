The interface I will be building can be seen below.

**Disclaimer: This is not my original design. This interface design was create by [Anna Kukhareva](https://dribbble.com/phosphoricc) and can be seen on [Dribbble](https://dribbble.com/shots/5815853-History-Tab).**

## Walkthrough

Alright, for those of you who need structure, here's the plan:

1. Build static UI with Reactjs (props only)
2. Build functional UI with Reactjs (props and state)
3. Apply Binary Search Algorithm within app.

### 3. Apply Binary Search Algorithm within app.

Alright, so what is the Binary Search Algorithm? Well if you haven't been clicking on the links I've provided above, essentially it is a very fast searching algorithm. But there is a catch, it has to be used on data that has already been
