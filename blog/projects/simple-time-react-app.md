I wanted to see the differences between building a clock app using vanilla JavaScript and using a library like React.

Here's what I found with using React:

- Easier to maintain/manage.
- Organization of certain parts of code (components).
- Easier for some other developer to pick up and work with app.

Here's what I found with using vanilla JavaScript:

- Easier to shape the structure of your app (more flexibility).
- Still easy to maintain/manage, but probably difficult for some other developer.

Another simple application with a lot of lessons behind it. Check out the demo on [codepen](https://codepen.io/mylesenri/pen/vVVORw).
