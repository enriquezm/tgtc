It's been awhile since I last redesigned an app/website so I gave myself the challenge to redesign the website for a MMA school that I go to, [Redemption Fight Team](http://www.redemptionfightteam.com/).

The current site is not horrible, but like all websites and apps, it could always be improved.

To me, it seemed as though the site did not have a goal prior to creation. I say this because it seemed as though content was just uploaded just to be there.

### Finding the Goal

So the first step for me was to define a goal and that goal was to get curious customers to convert and join the gym. With this goal in mind, I now had an endpoint. I knew where each user journey should eventually end up. It was important for me to define this because now I knew what could be removed from the original layout.

### Current Sitemap

The original site map looked like so:

        Home
        |_Programs
        |_Schedule
        |_BJJ Videos
        |_About Us
        | |_Instructors
        | |_Social
        |
        |_Contact

All the content for a working website was there, but it was not placed in the correct areas (if we're talking about getting those conversions).

### Our Audience

The primary target audience are parents. Now if we think like a parent, we can try to assume a couple things that they need. 

Those needs are:

- Schedule (because of work/school)
- Location
- Photos (need a peak for trust)
- Instructors (need to know how their kids will be with for those 2 hours)

Once these needs are met, you could assume that they would want to join. And that's were the convenience of joining is crucial.
