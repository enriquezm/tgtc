At first glance, the Google Trends Visualizer look complex. After breaking it down and looking at all the working pieces it didn't seem too bad.

If we were to dissect the app, it's simply a bunch of boxes, each with their own animations, timer, and content. So I thought to myself, "If I can get one working, I could use the power of React components, and make them all work."

Obviously, there's a lot more to it, but it was a start.
