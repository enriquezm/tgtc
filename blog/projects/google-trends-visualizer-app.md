I took a coding test that required us to make a replica of the [Google Trends Visualizer](https://trends.google.com/trends/hottrends/visualize?nrow=5&ncol=5). 

At first, I was a little overwhelmed. There was a lot going on, but like all projects that seem overwhelming, I went looking for my best friends "Pen" and "Paper".

For anything complex, I like to draw it all out. I get everything on paper, and then go from there.

Breaking down an interface seems so much easier when you have it drawn out. From my sketch I could then make out what would be components and how data would be passed back and forth.

You can view the source code for this project on [github](https://github.com/enriquezm/google-trends-visualizer).

Conclusion:

- I technically did finish the application but there were a couple things I wasn't too happy about. For one, I would use an array to store the states of all "trends". The reason for this would be because there would be built in methods I could run that JS would provide.
