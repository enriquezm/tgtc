This walkthrough is second of a series I'm calling "UI Build It". Essentially, I just break down an interface and build a prototype the "React Way". 

The actual steps to each of these projects in this series is to:

1. Pick an interface
2. Break it into a components
3. Organize the components into a hierarchy
4. Build a static prototype (using react props)
5. Build into a functioning prototype (using react props and state)

My main goal in this series is to get a better understanding of component composition within a React application. I will be using the official [Thinking In React Tutorial](https://reactjs.org/docs/thinking-in-react.html) to give my process a little structure.

## The Walkthrough

I'm going to walk you through my process for building the interface below in React.

### 1. Break The UI Into A Component Hierarchy

After taking a look at the interface I broke it down like so:
